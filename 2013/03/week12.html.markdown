It's been a week of big changes. Zeke moved from his bassinet to his crib at night (didn't really notice) and also upgraded his bathtub:

He started punching Mama:

And threatening Papa:

He also forgot how to roll over, which means more tummy-time:

But probably the biggest change of all was that it was Mama's first week back at work, and Zeke's first week staying home with PoPo Jenny:
