We sometimes call Zeke "Jiro," because of his resemblance to the great sushi chef. When he’s in his peaceful dreaming state, Joe and I pretend he’s dreaming of all the delicious sushi he will make for his papa and mama. If you haven’t seen the documentary, *[Jiro Dreams of Sushi](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1772925/)*, it’s definitely worth watching.
