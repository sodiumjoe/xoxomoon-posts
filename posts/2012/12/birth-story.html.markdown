Now that I’ve had a few days to settle in and gather my thoughts, I wanted to share our birth story with those who are interested. After going through labor myself, I’m more interested than ever in hearing every mother’s unique and amazing experience.

The only birth stories I’ve ever heard of were ones that took place at the hospital. Since moving to Portland, I started to hear more and more about home births, midwives and other alternative birth methods. I started to look more into it once I found out that I was pregnant and we finally chose a path that was comfortable for us. We went to see a group of midwives, took Hypnobirthing classes, and planned a hospital birth.

Overall, the labor was a success in that it was unmedicated, uncomplicated and Zeke was born healthy. We were in active labor for 14 hours and progressed pretty normally. However, it was definitely not what I had imagined in my head. First and foremost, the pain was nothing like I’ve ever experienced or could have imagined. I’d heard stories, seen movies, and read about labor experiences as I prepared for my own labor, but nothing could have prepared me for it. Someone asked me to describe the pain the other day. I guess for me, the contractions around 7-10 cm dilation felt like my stomach was ripped apart and then punched several times. Even now, I still feel like I’m mentally recovering from the experience. Hypnobirthing teaches you to meditate, relax, and breathe during the contractions, and I think it did help me be less tense. However, the biggest factor that helped me get through it unmedicated was a supportive and engaged partner. Joe was emotionally, mentally and physically there throughout the whole process. He was with me through every contraction, reminding me to relax and focus. He also reminded me how to breathe through the contractions. Looking back, I would not change anything about our birth plan. We loved our midmives and Providence hospital. We’re still not sure if Hypobirthing was the right fit for us but it definitely prepared us in a lot of ways.

Below is the detailed description of the birth if you’re interested -  

I first felt contractions on Friday morning, 12/14. They gradually strengthened throughout the day so Joe came home after lunch and stayed with me as the contractions got stronger and closer together.

That night, at around 1:30 AM, the contractions had gotten pretty strong, and were consistently about 5 minutes apart, so we headed to the hospital. When we got there, the nurse checked the cervix and it was only 1 cm dilated. We waited there for one hour and checked again and found that there there was not a whole lot of progress, so they gave us the option of going home. We decided that would be best so we went home.

At home, contractions continued. Joe was able to get a couple hours of sleep, but I had trouble sleeping because of the continued contractions. I was pretty much running back and forth to the bathroom, having contractions on top of the toilet all night. At about 7:30 AM on Saturday morning, I had a bloody show, and the contractions had gotten very strong (though later I would find out that that wasn’t very strong at all, compared to what was to come), so we decided to head back to the hospital. 

At the hospital, we were disappointed to find that my cervix had only progressed to 2 cm, though it was fully effaced. However, I was making progress, so the nurse recommended we stay there. So we stayed in that hospital room for the rest of the day, working through the contractions. The contractions between 2-6 cm, I was able to kinda breath and grunt through it although Joe had to do a lot of coaching. I was mostly on the toilet this whole time. 

Still the dilation progressed quite slowly. I was definitely disappointed by how little progress there was after each cervical exam. However, Zeke was making good progress by slowly descending.

After several hours of difficult contractions, the cervix was at 6 cm, but the amniotic sac was still intact. Mary, our midwife, recommended that we rupture the membrane to help the labor accelerate. Zeke was really low already so he was putting so much pressure on the cervix. I was in a lot of pain and wanted to speed up the labor, so we decided to go ahead with that. 

Unfortunately, cervical dilation was still quite slow after that, and it took many painful hours to get to 8 cm. I was breathing, grunting, and yelling through my contractions by now. At that point, Mary suggested the option of taking an epidural, so that I could relax and finish the dilation without pain. We thought about it for a while, but it seemed as though we were pretty close to full dilation, so we decided against the epidural. 

I instead chose to sit in the jacuzzi for a while to relieve some of the pressure and help with the pain management. I stayed there for almost an hour... relaxing in between contractions.

After getting out of the jacuzzi, I got my cervix checked again and it was at 9 cm. At that point, I was so exhausted from all the pain (This was 8 hours after we checked in). We considered the epidural again, but it seemed like we were still making progress and very close, so we decided against it. After some more time, our nurse, Annie, checked the cervix, and we were elated to find out that it was fully dilated. I was able to relax, and there was a small break in the contractions, so I was able to sleep for about 20 minutes. I don’t remember this part but Joe remembers how happy and relaxed I looked. 

Unfortunately, when Mary checked the cervix again, she found a small flap that was still not fully dilated. I was so disappointed and felt defeated. We considered the epidural again, but it seemed so close that it didn’t seem like the best idea. We kept working through the contractions, trying to let that last part of the cervix finally dilated. About every 20 minutes, Mary would check and after 1.5 hours of it not going away, Mary suggested starting pitocin, to make the contractions stronger, but I was in too much pain and didn’t think I could handle a stronger contraction. I think I was crying at this point. Joe was also crying. We were a mess. But we still fought through it, I did my best to relax and let the cervix completely dilate on its own.

Unfortunately, even over an hour later, that last part of the cervix still had not dilated, but Zeke was getting lower and lower. So Mary decided to try to manually tuck the flap back while I pushed to see if we could get the head past the cervix. We successfully did that in 2 contractions. After she said I was able to push, I caught my second wind and began to push with the last remaining strength I had. After about 45 minutes of pushing, Zeke came out! Because I was unmedicated, I was alert but exhausted. Zeke was put on my chest for skin-to-skin contact for his first breast feeding. He automatically latched and we were able to celebrate and relax the rest of the night with our new arrival.
