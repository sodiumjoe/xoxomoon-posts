My pregnancy with Bea came and went without much thought until pretty much the last few weeks of her arrival. I often forgot what week I was and did not touch a single book or research baby-related anything. She was definitely on my mind, but I didn't have the nervousness or concern I had when I was pregnant with Zeke.

I took two days off of work prior to the due date to give myself some time to relax and gather my thoughts, one day of pampering mama and one day of spending time with Zeke. The due date came and went and Bea took her time. I was more patient this time around. I knew the dramatic turn my lifestyle would take when she arrived. Less sleep, lots of feeding, and overall less time with Joe and Zeke. So I tried to savor and enjoy my time off by taking long solo walks in the park, finishing up little errands, a bit of shopping, and I even found time to do a bit of personal sketching. Our birth plan was similar to what we wanted for Zeke, unmedicated as much as I could bear it. There was definitely a part of me that assumed that it was going to be an unmedicated birth again.

My patience ran out around day 5. On Friday morning, 6 days after the due date (this was around the time I started having contractions with Zeke), I decided to take 4 tablespoons of castor oil mixed with OJ. Went about my day and had lunch with Joe at his work. I didn't feel anything until around after 6 pm. After many bowel movements, my stomach muscles felt tight and tense. Slight contractions started around 11 pm and continued all night. I told Joe to try and get some sleep because it might actually happen that night. Mild contractions kicked in around 1 am. Around 2 am, we called the midwives. We left for the hospital at around 2:30 am, at a point where I thought I would not be able to walk if I didn't go right then. Zeke was asleep in his room and we woke up Halmeoni to let her know.  It was nice that we did not have to say goodbye to Zeke, and he did not have to see his mama in pain.

We checked in at Providence Hospital around 2:45 am. The nurse that was assigned to us looked familiar. Joe finally remembered that she was our teacher from the Hypnobirthing class we took almost 4 years ago! In the birthing room, Joe filled the bathtub right away for me to soak in. Surprisingly, we kinda remembered all the birthing techniques we learned from the last time even though we didn't talk about it or practice. While waiting, I sat most of the time until the contractions hit. I had to walk around when it came (which was very different from Zeke's labor... all I wanted to do was sit on the toilet when the contractions hit). The baby was in the posterior position so anytime my back had to support me, it hurt too bad. We tried different positions but the most comfortable position was lying down upright on my side. Just like my labor with Zeke, after a few hours, my water did not break on its own and Joanna asked if I wanted to her to break it to move the labor along. Joe looked at me, unsure. Last time, the pressure came pretty strong after they broke my water so he wasn't sure if I wanted that again. I was pretty tired and I'm not someone who is very patient so I asked her to and labor continued.

At around 8 am, I felt the urge to go to the bathroom a few times and the nurses said it was time to try to push. Pushing Bea out took longer and was a lot more painful this time around. I felt like my pushing didn't go very far, and it took a long time for Bea to come out. Once she crowned, it was one of the most painful experience I've ever endured. She stopped at what felt like the widest part of her head. I screamed and yelled "It hurts!" and looked at everyone like they were crazy. The team and Joe of course just smiled and said I was doing great. I was really tired and didn't know if I had it in me to push anymore. After a few more pushes, I even asked if the midwife could just pull her out. For a minute, I understood why forceps were used long ago. Joe was asked if he wanted to catch her multiple times but he decided not too, thinking it should be left to the professionals, and because I was in so much pain when she crowned.

It was 9:25 am Saturday morning, after a few more pushes, Bea came out and joined our family. Our midwife asked Joe if he wanted to cut the umbilical cord and he did (It was much denser and tougher than he thought). I was a lot more alert and conscious this time around. It was still surreal and magical and everything in between. That moment of holding Bea was a bit different from the first time with Zeke. I had flashes of her growing up and walking and talking cause I already experienced it with Zeke. It was new and familiar and exciting all at the same time.

I only had 2 stitches and was able to walk around after a few hours. We stayed at the hospital for a night and left at around 1:30 pm the next day. Zeke was ecstatic to have "his" baby home. We were now a family of four!
