Zeke is a year old! It's been an eventful year for the Moons and we can hardly believe how quickly it's gone by. Zeke has filled our home with more joy and laughter than we could have imagined, and we look forward to the many adventures that await us!

This will be our last weekly post, though we'll try to post when we can.

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
