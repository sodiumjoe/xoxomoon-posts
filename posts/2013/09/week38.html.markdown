After the wedding in Bulgaria, the Moons took a detour to Istanbul.

We stayed near the historic Galata Tower:

And explored the city with Auntie Iris:

Zeke was very popular in Istanbul and got a lot kisses from strangers:

We visited the [Bophorus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosphorus), which separates Europe from Asia:

And walked through the [Hagia Sophia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagia_Sophia):

We did some shopping in the Grand Bazaar:

And bought some Turkish Delight at the Spice Bazaar:

We also saw a ton of Mosques:

Overall, Zeke was an excellent traveler:

Unfortunately, he got an ear infection toward the end of the trip, which made the return flight pretty unpleasant. He made it through, though, and made a trip to the pediatrician:

Istanbul is definitely on  of the great cities of the world and the trip rekindled our wanderlust. We can't wait to show Zeke what else the world has to offer.
