Joe and I wanted to commemorate the birth of our first baby and becoming new parents by giving each other heirloom gifts that we can pass down to Zeke, if he decides to become a parent one day.

The night Zeke was born, after we moved into our new room in the hospital and all the excitement had settled, we gave each other our gifts. Joe wasn’t expecting one but I knew he had gotten me a gift.

For Joe, I bought a vintage Hamilton military watch from Dec 1972. The GG-W-113 military specifications were established in 1967 for the USAF. These watches have a contrasting dial designed for pilots. The simplicity and reliability of the watch is its strength. Joe had been interested in vintage, WWII-era mechanical watches, especially Hamiltons but could never really afford one for himself. I liked the fact that the watch was genuine military issue, since Joe had served in the Marines. It was issued with a nylon NATO strap, but I replaced it with a Horween genuine shell cordovan leather strap so it would age better. Joe was surprised and very pleased with the gift.

Joe gave me a Nora Kogan Mama rose gold ring that was on my Pinterest page. A simple band with ‘mama’ engraved on the side and diamond set flush next to it. It’s subtle and sweet, just the way I like it. I wear it on top of my wedding band and will wear it until it’s time to pass it on.
